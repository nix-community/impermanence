# Given a source directory, /source, and a target directory,
# /target/foo/bar/bazz, we want to "clone" the target structure
# from source into the target. Essentially, we want both
# /source/target/foo/bar/bazz and /target/foo/bar/bazz to exist
# on the filesystem. More concretely, we'd like to map
# /state/etc/ssh/example.key to /etc/ssh/example.key
#
# To achieve this, we split the target's path into parts -- target, foo,
# bar, bazz -- and iterate over them while accumulating the path
# (/target/, /target/foo/, /target/foo/bar, and so on); then, for each of
# these increasingly qualified paths we:
#   1. Ensure both /source/qualifiedPath and qualifiedPath exist
#   2. Copy the ownership of the source path to the target path
#   3. Copy the mode of the source path to the target path

# Get inputs from command line arguments
