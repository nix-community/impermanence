#+TITLE: Impermanence

  Lets you choose what files and directories you want to keep between
  reboots - the rest are thrown away.

  Why would you want this?

  - It keeps your system clean by default.

  - It forces you to declare settings you want to keep.

  - It lets you experiment with new software without cluttering up
    your system.

  There are a few different things to set up for this to work:

  - A root filesystem which somehow gets wiped on reboot. There are a
    few ways to achieve this. See the [[#system-setup][System setup]] section for more info.

  - At least one mounted volume where the files and directories you
    want to keep are stored permanently.

  - At least one of the modules in this repository, which take care of
    linking or bind mounting files between the persistent storage
    mount point and the root file system. See the [[#module-usage][Module usage]] section
    for more info.

* System setup

  There are many ways to wipe your root partition between boots. This
  section lists a few common ways to accomplish this, but is by no
  means an exhaustive list.

*** tmpfs

    The easiest method is to use a tmpfs filesystem for the
    root. This is the easiest way to set up impermanence on systems
    which currently use a traditional filesystem (ext4, xfs, etc) as
    the root filesystem, since you don't have to repartition.

    All data stored in tmpfs only resides in system memory, not on
    disk. This automatically takes care of cleaning up between boots,
    but also comes with some pretty significant drawbacks:

    - Downloading big files or trying programs that generate large
      amounts of data can easily result in either an out-of-memory or
      disk-full scenario.

    - If the system crashes or loses power before you've had a chance
      to move files you want to keep to persistent storage, they're
      gone forever.

    Using tmpfs as the root filesystem, the filesystem setup would
    look something like this:

    #+begin_src nix
      {
        fileSystems."/" = {
          device = "none";
          fsType = "tmpfs";
          options = [ "defaults" "size=25%" "mode=755" ];
        };

        fileSystems."/persistent" = {
          device = "/dev/root_vg/root";
          neededForBoot = true;
          fsType = "btrfs";
          options = [ "subvol=persistent" ];
        };

        fileSystems."/nix" = {
          device = "/dev/root_vg/root";
          fsType = "btrfs";
          options = [ "subvol=nix" ];
        };

        fileSystems."/boot" = {
          device = "/dev/disk/by-uuid/XXXX-XXXX";
          fsType = "vfat";
        };
      }
    #+end_src

    where the ~size~ option determines how much system memory is allowed
    to be used by the filesystem.

*** BTRFS subvolumes

    A more advanced solution which doesn't have the same drawbacks as
    using tmpfs is to use a regular filesystem, but clean it up
    between boots. A relatively easy way to do this is to use BTRFS
    and create a new subvolume to use as root on boot. This also
    allows you to keep a number of old roots around, in case of
    crashes, power outages or other accidents.

    A setup which would automatically remove roots that are
    older than 30 days could look like this:

    #+begin_src nix
      {
        fileSystems."/" = {
          device = "/dev/root_vg/root";
          fsType = "btrfs";
          options = [ "subvol=root" ];
        };

        boot.initrd.postResumeCommands = lib.mkAfter ''
          mkdir /btrfs_tmp
          mount /dev/root_vg/root /btrfs_tmp
          if [[ -e /btrfs_tmp/root ]]; then
              mkdir -p /btrfs_tmp/old_roots
              timestamp=$(date --date="@$(stat -c %Y /btrfs_tmp/root)" "+%Y-%m-%-d_%H:%M:%S")
              mv /btrfs_tmp/root "/btrfs_tmp/old_roots/$timestamp"
          fi

          delete_subvolume_recursively() {
              IFS=$'\n'

              # If we accidentally end up with a file or directory under old_roots,
              # the code will enumerate all subvolumes under the main volume.
              # We don't want to remove everything under true main volume. Only
              # proceed if this path is a btrfs subvolume (inode=256).
              if [ $(stat -c %i "$1") -ne 256 ]; then return; fi

              for i in $(btrfs subvolume list -o "$1" | cut -f 9- -d ' '); do
                  delete_subvolume_recursively "/btrfs_tmp/$i"
              done
              btrfs subvolume delete "$1"
          }

          for i in $(find /btrfs_tmp/old_roots/ -maxdepth 1 -mtime +30); do
              delete_subvolume_recursively "$i"
          done

          btrfs subvolume create /btrfs_tmp/root
          umount /btrfs_tmp
        '';

        fileSystems."/persistent" = {
          device = "/dev/root_vg/root";
          neededForBoot = true;
          fsType = "btrfs";
          options = [ "subvol=persistent" ];
        };

        fileSystems."/nix" = {
          device = "/dev/root_vg/root";
          fsType = "btrfs";
          options = [ "subvol=nix" ];
        };

        fileSystems."/boot" = {
          device = "/dev/disk/by-uuid/XXXX-XXXX";
          fsType = "vfat";
        };
      }
    #+end_src

    This assumes the BTRFS filesystem can be found in an LVM volume
    group called ~root_vg~. Adjust the path as necessary.

* Module usage

  There are currently two modules: one for ~NixOS~ and one for ~home-manager~.

*** NixOS

    To use the module, import it into your configuration with

    #+begin_src nix
      {
        imports = [ /path/to/impermanence/nixos.nix ];
      }
    #+end_src

    or use the provided ~nixosModules.impermanence~ flake output:

    #+begin_src nix
      {
        inputs = {
          impermanence.url = "github:nix-community/impermanence";
        };

        outputs = { self, nixpkgs, impermanence, ... }:
          {
            nixosConfigurations.sythe = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
              system = "x86_64-linux";
              modules = [
                impermanence.nixosModules.impermanence
                ./machines/sythe/configuration.nix
              ];
            };
          };
      }
    #+end_src

    This adds the ~environment.persistence~ option, which is an
    attribute set of submodules, where the attribute name is the path
    to persistent storage.

    Usage is shown best with an example:

    #+begin_src nix
      {
        environment.persistence."/persistent" = {
          enable = true;  # NB: Defaults to true, not needed
          hideMounts = true;
          directories = [
            "/var/log"
            "/var/lib/bluetooth"
            "/var/lib/nixos"
            "/var/lib/systemd/coredump"
            "/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections"
            { directory = "/var/lib/colord"; user = "colord"; group = "colord"; mode = "u=rwx,g=rx,o="; }
          ];
          files = [
            "/etc/machine-id"
            { file = "/var/keys/secret_file"; parentDirectory = { mode = "u=rwx,g=,o="; }; }
          ];
          users.talyz = {
            directories = [
              "Downloads"
              "Music"
              "Pictures"
              "Documents"
              "Videos"
              "VirtualBox VMs"
              { directory = ".gnupg"; mode = "0700"; }
              { directory = ".ssh"; mode = "0700"; }
              { directory = ".nixops"; mode = "0700"; }
              { directory = ".local/share/keyrings"; mode = "0700"; }
              ".local/share/direnv"
            ];
            files = [
              ".screenrc"
            ];
          };
        };
      }
    #+end_src

    - ~"/persistent"~ is the path to your persistent storage location

      This allows for multiple different persistent storage
      locations. If you, for example, have one location you back up
      and one you don't, you can use both by defining two separate
      attributes under ~environment.persistence~.

    - ~enable~ determines whether the persistent storage location should
      be enabled or not. Useful when sharing configurations between
      systems with and without impermanence setups. Defaults to ~true~.

    - ~hideMounts~ allows you to specify whether to hide the
      bind mounts from showing up as mounted drives in the file
      manager. If enabled, it sets the mount option ~x-gvfs-hide~
      on all the bind mounts.

    - ~directories~ are all directories you want to bind mount to
      persistent storage. A directory can be represented either as a
      string, simply denoting its path, or as a submodule. The
      submodule representation is useful when the default assumptions,
      mainly regarding permissions, are incorrect. The available
      options are:

      - ~directory~, the path to the directory you want to bind mount
        to persistent storage. Only setting this option is
        equivalent to the string representation.

      - ~persistentStoragePath~, the path to persistent
        storage. Defaults to the ~environment.persistence~ submodule
        name, i.e. ~"/persistent"~ in the example. This should most
        likely be left to its default value - don't change it unless
        you're certain you really need to.

      - ~user~, the user who should own the directory. If the directory
        doesn't already exist in persistent storage, it will be
        created and this user will be its owner. This also applies to
        any parent directories which don't yet exist. Changing this
        once the directory has been created has no effect.

      - ~group~, the group who should own the directory. If the
        directory doesn't already exist in persistent storage, it will
        be created and this group will be its owner. This also applies
        to any parent directories which don't yet exist. Changing this
        once the directory has been created has no effect.

      - ~mode~, the permissions to set for the directory. If the
        directory doesn't already exist in persistent storage, it will
        be created with this mode. Can be either an octal mode
        (e.g. ~0700~) or a symbolic mode (e.g. ~u=rwx,g=,o=~). Parent
        directories that don't yet exist are created with default
        permissions. Changing this once the directory has been created
        has no effect.

    - ~files~ are all files you want to link or bind to persistent
      storage. A file can be represented either as a string, simply
      denoting its path, or as a submodule. The submodule
      representation is useful when the default assumptions, mainly
      regarding the permissions of its parent directory, are
      incorrect. The available options are:

      - ~file~, the path to the file you want to bind mount to
        persistent storage. Only setting this option is equivalent to
        the string representation.

      - ~persistentStoragePath~, the path to persistent
        storage. Defaults to the ~environment.persistence~ submodule
        name, i.e. ~"/persistent"~ in the example. This should most
        likely be left to its default value - don't change it unless
        you're certain you really need to.

      - ~parentDirectory~, the permissions that should be applied to the
        file's parent directory, if it doesn't already
        exist. Available options are ~user~, ~group~ and ~mode~. See their
        definition in ~directories~ above.

      If the file exists in persistent storage, it will be bind
      mounted to the target path; otherwise it will be symlinked.

    - ~users.talyz~ handles files and directories in ~talyz~'s home
      directory

      The ~users~ option defines a set of submodules which correspond to
      the users' names. The ~directories~ and ~files~ options of each
      submodule work like their root counterparts, but the paths are
      automatically prefixed with with the user's home directory.

      If the user has a non-standard home directory (i.e. not
      ~/home/<username>~), the ~users.<username>.home~ option has to be
      set to this path - it can't currently be automatically deduced
      due to a limitation in ~nixpkgs~.

    /Important note:/ Make sure your persistent volumes are marked with
    ~neededForBoot~, otherwise you will run into problems.

*** home-manager

    Usage of the ~home-manager~ module is very similar to the one of the
    ~NixOS~ module - the key differences are that the ~persistence~ option
    is now under ~home~, rather than ~environment~, and the addition of
    the submodule option ~removePrefixDirectory~.

    /Important note:/ You have to use the ~home-manager~ ~NixOS~ module (in
    the ~nixos~ directory of ~home-manager~'s repo) in order for this
    module to work as intended.

    To use the module, import it into your configuration with

    #+begin_src nix
      {
        imports = [ /path/to/impermanence/home-manager.nix ];
      }
    #+end_src

    or use the provided ~homeManagerModules.impermanence~ flake output:

    #+begin_src nix
      {
        inputs = {
          home-manager.url = "github:nix-community/home-manager";
          impermanence.url = "github:nix-community/impermanence";
        };

        outputs =
          {
            home-manager,
            nixpkgs,
            impermanence,
            ...
          }:
          {
            nixosConfigurations.sythe = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
              system = "x86_64-linux";
              modules = [
                {
                  imports = [ home-manager.nixosModules.home-manager ];

                  home-manager.users.username =
                    { ... }:
                    {
                      imports = [
                        impermanence.homeManagerModules.impermanence
                        ./home/impermanence.nix # Your home-manager impermanence-configuration
                      ];
                    };
                }
              ];
            };
          };
      }
    #+end_src

    This adds the ~home.persistence~ option, which is an attribute set
    of submodules, where the attribute name is the path to persistent
    storage.

    Usage is shown best with an example:

    #+begin_src nix
      {
        home.persistence."/persistent/home/talyz" = {
          directories = [
            "Downloads"
            "Music"
            "Pictures"
            "Documents"
            "Videos"
            "VirtualBox VMs"
            ".gnupg"
            ".ssh"
            ".nixops"
            ".local/share/keyrings"
            ".local/share/direnv"
            {
              directory = ".local/share/Steam";
              method = "symlink";
            }
          ];
          files = [
            ".screenrc"
          ];
          allowOther = true;
        };
      }
    #+end_src

    - ~"/persistent/home/talyz"~ is the path to your persistent storage location
    - ~directories~ are all directories you want to link to persistent storage
        - It is possible to switch the linking ~method~ between bindfs (the
          default) and symbolic links.
    - ~files~ are all files you want to link to persistent storage. These are
      symbolic links to their target location.
    - ~allowOther~ allows other users, such as ~root~, to access files
      through the bind mounted directories listed in
      ~directories~. Useful for ~sudo~ operations, Docker, etc. Requires
      the NixOS configuration ~programs.fuse.userAllowOther = true~.

    Additionally, the ~home-manager~ module allows for compatibility
    with ~dotfiles~ repos structured for use with [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]], where the
    files linked to are one level deeper than where they should end
    up. This can be achieved by setting ~removePrefixDirectory~ to ~true~:

    #+begin_src nix
      {
        home.persistence."/etc/nixos/home-talyz-nixpkgs/dotfiles" = {
          removePrefixDirectory = true;
          files = [
            "screen/.screenrc"
          ];
          directories = [
            "fish/.config/fish"
          ];
        };
      }
    #+end_src

    In the example, the ~.screenrc~ file and ~.config/fish~ directory
    should be linked to from the home directory; ~removePrefixDirectory~
    removes the first part of the path when deciding where to put the
    links.

    /Note:/ When using ~bindfs~ fuse filesystem for directories, the names of
    the directories you add will be visible in the ~/etc/mtab~ file and in the
    output of ~mount~ to all users.
